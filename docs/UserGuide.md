TimesTable is a **desktop app for managing your tuition students and classes, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TimesTable can get your class management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer, if you do not, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-linux).

1. Download the latest `timestable.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample student data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press 'Enter' to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing 'Enter' will open the help window.<br>
   Here are some example commands which you can use on our sample students data before using your own students data:

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
   
   * **`sort`****`name`****`asc`** : Sorts the students by their name in ascending alphabetic order.
    
   * **`addclass`**`cn/Sec 4 A Maths ct/mon 11:30-13:30 r/70 l/Nex Tuition Center`: Adds a new class with name 'Sec 4 A Maths', with class timing MON 11.30-13:30, with hourly rate of $70, at Nex Tuition Center.
    
   * **`addtoclass`**`1 1 2 3`: Adds the 1st, 2nd and 3rd student in the student list in the `students` tab into the 1st class in the `classes` tab

   * **`view`**`classes` : Changes the tab the user is on to the `classes` tab which displays all the classes.
   
   * **`view`**`timetable` : Changes the tab the user is on to the `timetable` tab which displays a timetable with all the classes. 
   
   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Once you are ready to use your fill in Timestable with your own students, simply use the  **`clear`** command to deletes all the sample students, instead of having to delete them one by one.
   Now you can start putting your students into Timestable.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* For commands that require next-ok-kin (NOK) information, all inputs regarding NOK should be after `nok/` and all
  inputs regarding the student should be before `nok/`. Timestable does not allow order swap!<br>
  e.g. `n/John p/97833242 … /nok n/Harry p/87738383 …` John and 97833242 are information belonging to the student
  and John's NOK's name is Harry whose phone number is 87738383.

```

* This is a command that requires next-of-kin (NOK) information.
* This command is split into two segments (excluding command keyword). The first segment are the inputs before
  `nok/` and the second segment are the inputs after `nok/`.
    * The segments are not fixed in order and inputs in the
      first segment are about student information whereas inputs in the second segment are about NOK's information.
* The order of input within its own segment is swappable.
