## **Acknowledgements**

- The [`Timetable`](#timetable-ui) feature was inspired by a similar feature in the past project of [Pet Store Helper](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W15-4/main).

  The implementation of the components of the [`Timetable`](#timetable-ui) feature (`TimetableTuitionClassSlot`, `TimetableDay`, `TimetableRegion` and `TimetableEmptySlot`) has been adapted from them with maximum changes to fit our app.
  The implementation of how we [built and designed](#timetable-feature) ([TimetablePanel.java](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/times/ui/timetabletab/TimetablePanel.java)) the entire Timetable Tab (layout, classes etc) is entirely new.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/times/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/times/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/times/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` etc, and a TabPane consisting of `StudentsUi`, `ClassesUi` and `TimetableUi`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/times/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- observes the `Command` abstract class in the `Logic` component, because it needs to update when certain commands are run.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` and `TuitionClass` objects residing in the `Model`.

#### Students UI

![StudentsUi Class Diagram](images/StudentsDiagram.png)

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The `StudentListPanel` is made up of `StudentCard`s, which displays information about the `Student`s. The `StudentListPanel` takes in an `ObservableList<Student>`, which builds a `StudentCard` for each student.
=======

#### Timetable UI

Adapted from [here](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W15-4/main/tree/master/src/main/java/clzzz/helper/ui/calendar). You can find more details in the [acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) section.

![TimetableUi Class Diagram](images/TimetableDiagram.png)

The `TimetablePanel` is made up of `TimetableDay`, `TimetableHeader`, `TimetableTuitionClassSlot` and `TimetableEmptySlot`.
They represent the day panel on the left, the header at the top with the label and timings, the slots representing the `TuitionClass`es and the empty slots between `TuitionClass`es respectively.
The `TimetablePanel` takes in an `ObservableList<TuitionClass>` to build the Timetable.

#### Classes UI

![Structure of ClassPanel](images/ClassPanelDiagram.png)

The ClassPanel consists of a `TuitionClassPanel` and a `StudentClassPanel`.  
They represent the left and right panels of the GUI respectively.
`TuitionClassPanel` takes in both an `ObservableList<TuitionClass>` and an `ObservableList<Student>`, while
`StudentClassPanel` takes in only an `ObservableList<Student>`.  
`TuitionClassPanel` requires an `ObservableList<Student>` for the purpose of filtering the Student List based on the selected `TuitionClass`.
![img.png](images/ClassPanelImage.png)  
`TuitionClassPanel` and `StudentClassPanel` both contain their respective `Card`s for each element in their respective `ObservableList`.  
Note that `StudentClassTabCard` is different from the `StudentCard` in the `studenttab` package so we have less coupling and for future extensibility.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/times/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

![Logic class diagram](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

[comment]: <> (<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>)

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TimesTableParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`. The `Command` object may call the `CommandObserver` to update the `UI` if necessary.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a `Student`).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `TimesTableParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to
  parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TimesTableParser` returns
  back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/times/model/Model.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

- stores the TimesTable data.
  - All `Student` objects which are contained in `UniqueStudentList`.
  - All `TuitionClass` objects which are contained in `UniqueClassList`.
- stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_
  list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed'
  e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- Similarly, the currently 'selected' `TuitionClass` objects are stored in a separated _filtered_ list which is exposed
  to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<TuitionClass>`.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

The `Student` and `NOK` class (next-of-kin) extends the `Person` class. The `Student` class's structure is as follows:

![Structure of the UI Component](images/StudentModelClassDiagram.png)

The structure of the `TuitionClass` class is as follows:

![Structure of the UI Component](images/TuitionClassModelClassDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:

**Note about the model design:**<br>

The `StudentNameList` contains a `List<Name>`, and the diagram omits the relationship that `Student` and `NOK` are subclasses of the abstract class `Person`.

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/times/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramWTuitionClass.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both TimesTable data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `TimesTableStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).
- `JsonAdaptedStudent` are saved in a `List<JsonAdaptedStudent>` and `JsonAdaptedTuitionClass` are saved in a
  `List<JsonAdaptedTuitionClass>`.
- `JsonAdaptedTag`s are stored in `JsonAdaptedStudent` as a `List<JsonAdaptedTag>`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.times.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Classes Tab feature

The Classes Tab feature allows one to see the user's classes and each class' corresponding students.

#### Implementation

![Structure of Class Ui](images/ClassPanelDiagram.png)  
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The class diagram for the Class Ui feature as shown in the [Classes Ui component](#classes-ui) is replicated here for convenience.  
=======

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
`TuitionClassPanel` and `StudentClassPanel` are both contained in their respective `StackPane` located below their respective `Label`s.

![Classes Ui Sequence Diagram.png](images/ClassesUiSequenceDiagram.png)

1. `MainWindow#fillInnerParts()` creates a new `ClassPanel` using the `ObservableList<Student>` and the `ObservableList<TuitionClass>` from `Logic`.
2. A `StudentClassPanel` and a `TuitionClassPanel` is created using the `ObservableList<Student>` and `ObservableList<TuitionClass>`.
3. `StudentClassPanel` and `TuitionClassPanel` create their respective cells for each `Student`/`TuitionClass` present.
4. `TuitionClassPanel#setStudentClassList()` is run by taking in the `ListView<Student>` from the `StudentClassPanel`. This is to render the students in the `StudentClassPanel` in the `TuitionClassPanel` as well.
5. Afterwards, when a `TuitionClassCard` is double clicked, `TuitionClassCard#onMouseClick()` bound to the fxml file is called, calling `TuitionClassCard#selectTuitionClass()`.
6. The `filtered` method is then run on the `studentList` to return a `newStudentList` which is filtered by all the students belonging to the `tuitionClass`.
7. The `tuitionClassListView` is set to the `newStudentList` created and thus rendered.

### Timetable Tab feature

The Timetable Tab feature is a feature which displays the user's classes in a visual timetable format.

#### Implementation

The class diagram for Timetable as shown in the [TimetableUI component](#timetable-ui) is replicated here for convenience.
![Timetable Class Diagram](images/TimetableDiagram.png)

The image below shows the respective parts of the `TimetablePanel`:

![Timetable annotation](images/TimetableAnnotation.png)

- The green box represents the `TimetableDay`, and there are 7 `TimetableDay` parts to represent the 7 days of the week.
- The yellow box represents the `TimetableHeader`, with the box all the way at the left with the label "Time Slots" representing the `TimetableHeaderLabel`, and the others representing the `TimetableHeaderTiming`. There is always 1 `TimetableHeaderLabel` but can have many `TimetableHeaderTiming` parts depending on the earliest start time and latest end time of the week.
- The dark blue box represents the `TimetableEmptySlot`.
- The light blue box represents the `TimetableTuitionClassSlot`.

[comment]: <> (Due to the limited size of the application's window, the Timetable UI would adjust itself and starts the days of the Timetable UI with the)

[comment]: <> (earliest start timing and ends with the latest end timing so that the timetable is not cluttered. There is a time panel at the top to indicate what)

The sequence diagrams below illustrate how the Timetable UI is built.

![Timetable Overall Sequence Diagram](images/TimetableUiSequenceDiagram.png)

1. `MainWindow#fillInnerParts()` creates a new `TimetablePanel` using the `ObservableList<TuitionClass>` from `Logic`.
2. `TimetablePanel#build()` is called in the constructor of `TimetablePanel` to build the Timetable Ui.
3. `TimetablePanel#build()` starts building the Timetable Ui by first calling `TimetablePanel#buildHeader()` which takes in the `ObservableList<TuitionClass>`.

    ![Timetable Header Sequence Diagram](images/TimetableUiHeaderSequenceDiagram.png)

4. Based on the `Timetable#buildHeader()` reference frame above, it builds the `TimetableHeaderLabel` first, followed by the `TimetableHeaderTiming`s, starting from the earliest start time of the `ObservableList<TuitionClass>` until the latest end time of the `ObservableList<TuitionClass>` in 30 minutes interval.

    ![Timetable Day Sequence Diagram](images/TimetableUiDaySequenceDiagram.png)

5. After `TimetablePanel#buildHeader()` is called, it would call `TimetablePanel#buildDays()`, which builds 7 `TimetableDay` objects to represent the 7 days of the week.

    ![Timetable Slot Sequence Diagram](images/TimetableUiSlotSequenceDiagram.png)

6. Finally, the `TimetablePanel#buildClasses()` is called, which takes in the same `ObservableList<TuitionClass>` as step 3. It iterates through the _sorted_ `ObservableList<TuitionClass>`, building a `TimetableTuitionClassSlot` for each of the `TuitionClass`, and placing `TimetableEmptySlot`s in between the `TimetableTuitionClassSlot`s.
7. A listener is attached to the `ObservableList<TuitionClass>` which updates the Timetable UI whenever there are changes to the `ObservableList<TuitionClass>`,
   such as when a new `TuitionClass` is added, or an existing `TuitionClass` is edited in the `ObservableList<TuitionClass>`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** This is just a high level explanation of how the Timetable UI is built, with the low level details being abstracted away.

### Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is facilitated by the `CommandObserver` who represents the `Observer`. It observes the abstract `Command` class.

#### Implementation

The class diagram below shows how we implemented the structure of the Observer Pattern.

![Command Observer Pattern](images/CommandObserverPattern.png)

The `MainWindow` from `UI` component implements both the `Ui` and `CommandObserver` interface as it plays the role of the `Ui` as well as a `CommandObserver`. The `MainWindow` observes the `Command` class, who calls `CommandObserver#updateView()`, `CommandObserver#updateClass()` and `CommandObserver#hideTuitionClassList()` depending on what Command `XYZCommand` is.

For eg, the `ViewComand` calls `CommandObserver#updateView()` to set the displayed tab of the `CommandObserver` to the tab specified. Additionally, the `AddToClassCommand` calls both `CommandObserver#updateClass()` and `CommandObserver#updateView()` to update the class details and updates the view to the `Classes` tab when we execute the `AddToClassCommand`.

#### Design Considerations

1. (Bad) After each command call, set a variable in the `CommandResult` to be the value of the Tab to change to, or a boolean value to see if we need to update the class. The `MainWindow` would then check the variables in `CommandResult` in `MainWindow#executeCommand()`, and updates the tab or class accordingly.
   - This is a very bad and inefficient method as the `MainWindow` would have to constantly check the `CommandResult` after every `Command`.
   - With the addition of new variables in `CommandResult`, it has the potential to introduce more bugs and make the code more unreadable. Additionally, other classes may also be able to access these variables accidentally, as they have to be `public` in order for `MainWindow` to access them, leading to unwanted consequences.
2. (Good) Follow the Observer Pattern taught in CS2103T, where we register the `MainWindow` as a `CommandObserver` to observe the abstract `Command` class, and will only get updated when necessary.
   - This is a more efficient method as the `MainWindow` does not have to always check the `CommandResult` after each execution.
   - No new variables are needed to be introduced into the `CommandResult`, keeping our code neater and less bug prone.

### `add` and `edit` commands to include next-of-kin `nok`


#### Implementation
The solution that we came up with was very simple. we just had to split the string by `/nok` and put both of the split
portions into the parser. Modifying the existing `parser` was not needed at all. we learnt that oftentimes for a small feature, we don't have
to go for the most extensible or "smart" solution, but the simplest to understand.

#### Design Considerations
Initially, it appeared challenging to us because the current `Parser` is only able to parse contents _between_ tags, but not encompass other tags within recursively.  
For example, `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/Chemistry t/Sec 3 nok/ n/Jack Doe p/10987654 e/jackd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25` requires us to parse the tags before and after `nok/` _separately_, which is a challenging problem to think about at first.

1. (Bad) We thought of a recursive implementation of the `Parser`, calling `parse` methods again on the two halves whenever we find an `/nok` tag, but
it proved to be too lofty and unneccesarily complicated. Moreover, using recursion in applications is not recommended due to the high potential
of unseen bugs.

2. (Bad) We thought of modifying the parser such that it always checks for the `/nok` tag (or any of the tags specified in the parameter) _first_, before parsing the other tags
in the normal way. However, this was again too large scale for a single command with the same parameter.


### Find commands

The find commands are a common group of commands that allows users to quickly find `Student` or `TuitionClass`. They are:
* `findname`
* `findtag`
* `findclass`
* `findclassname`

#### Implementation of the command

The implementation of all search-related commands such as `findtag`, `findname`, `findclass` and `findclassname` uses a
common approach of setting a `Predicate` inside the corresponding `FilteredList` class. As mentioned above in [`Model`](#model-component)
section, the filtered list either contains an `ObservableList<Student>` or `ObservableList<TuitionClass>` that is bound to the
UI such that UI is responsive to any changes in the list and these changes can be brought forward by setting a new
`Predicate`. One should also note that the default `Predicate` always returns a boolean `true` which means no `Student`
or `TuitionClass`is filtered out at the start.

The sequence diagram when a `findtag` command is executed is as follows:

![Sequence of execution when a findtag command is executed](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

The rest of the find command works the same way but note that for `findclass` and `findclassname`, they are calling the
`setPredicate` method of `filteredTuitionClass` instead.

#### Implementation of find predicates

Furthermore, to fully understand the find command, we also have to understand how `Predicate` works. The `Predicate`s used
that filters out students or classes are typical java `Predicate`. For each searchable attribute, a new class must be
created that implements `Predicate` with the right generic type (i.e. predicate class for filtering `Student` must
implement `Predicate<Student>`, and predicate class for filtering `TuitionClass` must implement `Predicate<TuitionClass>`).
Each custom predicate class contains a `List` of search strings that would be used to match against the tested items
in the search.

### View feature

The `Students` tab, `Classes` tab and `Timetable` tab, are parts of the [`UI Component`](#ui-component).
Navigation between these tabs without the mouse is crucial for our application as the target audience are people who prefer keyboard to mouse or voice commands.

The `view` feature is facilitated by the `ViewCommand`, which extends the abstract `Command` class. The `ViewCommand` sets the displayed tab to be the tab specified by the user.

#### Implementation

The sequence diagram for the `view` command is shown below.

![Sequence Diagram for view command](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

The `ViewCommand` calls the `CommandObserver#updateView(TabName)`, which updates the view of the `CommandObserver`s watching the `Command` abstract class to the `TabName` specified.
In this case, the only `CommandObserver` is the `MainWindow`, thus it updates the view of the `MainWindow` to display the `TIMETABLE` Tab at index 2.

`TabName` is an enumeration which represents the three tabs (`Students`, `Classes`, and `Timetable`), and their respective tab index (0 for `Students`, 1 for `Classes` and 2 for `Timetable`).

### Sort feature

The `sort` feature allows sorting of the `Student`s and `TuitionClass`es. It is able to sort it by `Student` name or `ClassTiming`, in ascending or descending order.

The `sort` feature is facilitated by the `SortCommand`, which extends the abstract `Command` class.

#### Implementation

The sequence diagram for the `sort` command is shown below.

![Sequence Diagram for sort command](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

The `sort` command sorts the `ObservableList<Student>` or the `ObservableList<TuitionClass>` in the `Model` component, whose results gets immediately reflected in their respective `Students` tab or `Classes` Tab.
After sorting, the `Command` sets the view to switch to their respective tabs, so that the user would be able to see the changes.

### Adding a Student to a class

`addtoclass` command adds an existing `Student` into an existing `TuitionClass`.

#### Implementation of the parser

`addtoclass` command's parser `AddToClassCommandParser` works by parsing indexes in the user input and
generating a `List<Index>` whereby the first index will be for the `TuitionClass` receiving the `Student`s and the rest
of the index being the `Student`s to be added into the `TuitionClass`. The only thing to note is that the parser
will only see zero and negative indices as invalid and not
out-of-range indices. This is because at the time of parsing, the model is not accessed to check if the indices are
out-of-range. The reason for this design is to reduce dependency and keep to the single responsibility principle. The
job of the parser should be separated from checking in with the model.

#### Implementation of the command

The `addtoclass` command follows an index based format and the `TuitionClass` contains the `Index` of the class to add
the new students to and a `List` of `Index` of students to be added. The command's execution is composed of various
smaller steps. The steps are listed below:

1. Check indices are not out-of-range
2. Generate a list of `Name`s to be added to the class
3. Produce the new student `StudentNameList` based on the class's existing `StudentNameList` and the list of `Name`s to
   be added
4. Creating the right `EditClassDescriptor`
5. Updating the `Model` with updated `TuitionClass`

(Note that updating view action is omitted)

The following sequence diagram gives an overview of the execution:

The sequence diagram for the second reference frame from above:

![AddToClass Sequence](images/AddToClassRef2.png)

### Removing Student(s) from a Tuition Class
Allows the user to remove one or more `Student`s from a selected `TuitionClass`.

#### Implementation
The `removefromclass` command follows a similar execution path as other commands. The user input is passed to
the `LogicManager`, which parses the input using the `TimesTableParser` and `RemoveFromClassCommandParser`.
A `RemoveFromClassCommand` is then created with the class and student indices involved in the command.
The command is then executed, interacting with the `Model`.

An overview of how the `RemoveFromClassCommand` is created is shown by this sequence diagram:

![RemoveFromClass Overview Sequence Diagram](images/RemoveFromClassOverviewDiagram.png)

#### Challenges faced

The challenging aspect in removing students from a tuition class is in figuring out which students to remove.

The `RemoveFromClassCommandParser` parses the user input to obtain a list of indexes to be passed to the `RemoveFromClassCommand`.
As such, the `RemoveFromClassCommand` only has access to a list of indices. We can easily obtain the `TuitionClass` object by
simply using the class index with `Model#getFilteredTuitionClassList()`. 

On the other hand, the `TuitionClass` object only stores
the `Name` of each `Student` in the `TuitionClass`. This was done as we use immutable objects throughout TimesTable. As such, if the user
modifies any of the fields of a `Student` using the `edit` command, then we would have to reflect the change throughout all the tuition classes
of the student. By only storing the `Name` of the `Student` in the `TuitionClass` object, then we only have to update all the `TuitionClass`
objects if the user modifies the `Name` field of the `Student`.

However, this decision results in added complexity when removing students from tuition classes. This is due to the fact that the `Name`s
stored in the `TuitionClass` object are in the order in which the students were added, but the order of the students as displayed in the
GUI is dependent on the `sort` and `find` commands used by the user. As such, the indices entered by the user do not correspond with the
actual `Names` stored in the `TuitionClass` object.

To solve this problem, we have to obtain the list of students in the order displayed by the GUI. To obtain this list,
we use the same method that the GUI uses to display the list in the first place. We use `Model#getFilteredStudentList()`,
then filter it to the students whose `Name`s are in the `TuitionClass` that we are concerned with. From here, we can now use the
student indices entered by the user to obtain the `Name`s of the corresponding `Students` in the filtered list. Then we can create
a new `TuitionClass` object with an updated list of `Name`s and replace the old `TuitionClass` with this new one.

An overview of the process is shown below:

![RemoveFromClass Internal Diagram](images/RemoveFromClassCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Deleting Tuition Class

Deletes a `TuitionClass` from the `classes` list in the `Classes` tab, to delete a tuition class, the `deleteclass`
command is used.

#### Implementation

1. The `DeleteCommandParser` parses the user input to obtain the index of the class to be deleted.
2. A `DeleteCommand` is created with the index of the tuition class to be deleted.
3. The `DeleteCommand#execute()` is run, the TimesTable is searched to find the tuition class to be deleted.
4. That tuition class is then deleted from the `Model` and the `UniqueClassList` by extension.

A diagram of the procedure is shown below:

### Adding Tuition Class

Adds a new tuition class into the `classes` list in the `Classes` tab with all the relevant detail, to add a tuition
class, the `addclass` command is used.

#### Implementation

1. The `AddClassCommandParser` parses the user input to obtain 4 parameters: `ClassName`, `ClassTiming`, `Rate` and
   `Location`.
2. The parser checks if the user has inputted valid value for these 4 parameter.
3. These 4 parameters and a new empty`StudentNameList` are then used to create a new `TuitionClass` to be passed into a new `AddClassCommand(TuitionClass)`
   as an argument. 
4. This command is then executed and the new `TuitionClass` is added into the `Model` and into the
   `UniqueClassList`, where further checks are done to ensure that there is no overlapping timing between the new
   `TuitionClass` that is to be added and other already existing `TuitionClass`es in the list, as TimesTable is made for a
   single user and thus designed to not allow overlapping `TuitionClass`es

The sequence diagram when a `AddClass` command is executed by the LogicManager is as follows:

![Sequence diagram when AddClass command is executed in LogicManger](images/AddClassSequenceDiagram.png)

![Reference frame of AddClass command](images/AddClassRef1.png)

The sequence diagram when a new `TuitionClass` is added to the `Model` is as follows

**Value proposition**: <br>
A busy tutor who has a large number of students can find it extremely difficult to

- manage and organize student information
- schedule according to student class timing

This is where Timestable comes in. It improves two main areas:

- querying
  - student information
  - parent information
  - class timing
- data manipulation
  - add
  - edit
  - delete

By improving the data manipulation process, the tutor can organize student information more easily. <br>
By improving the querying process, the tutor can make scheduling less painstaking and time-consuming.
